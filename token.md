# 🔐 What is a Token?
- A token is like a digital key. It's a small piece of data that proves who you are or that you have permission to do something.

# 🧠 Real-life Example:
- Imagine you log into a website:
- You enter your email and password.
- The server checks your info.
- ✅ If you're correct, the server gives you a token.
- 🪪 You use that token to access protected pages (like your profile).

# 🧒 Imagine this:
- You go to a cinema.
- 🎟️ At the entrance, you buy a ticket.
- 👮 The guard checks the ticket and lets you in.
- 🍿 Inside, you show the same ticket if anyone asks again.
- 🧾 Now in the world of websites:

---------------
- You = user
- Ticket = token
- Cinema = a website or app
- Guard = the server
